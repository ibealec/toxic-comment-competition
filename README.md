# toxic-comment-competition
This is my attempt at the toxic competition on kaggle.

I've organized all of the models that use word embeddings into corresponding iPython notebooks. 

You'll notice that each one is designed like a sandbox, testing several neural net architectures specified in "architecture.py".

I've taken my best results from every type of model and collected them into an ensemble, then applied the *Toxic Avenger* technique by the1owl.
